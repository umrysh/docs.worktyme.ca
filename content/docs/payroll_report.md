Select whether you would like to have the report split the time into divisions, select the date range you would like the report to cover and then click the button titled "Export the data". You will be prompted to download a XLSX containing your report.

_**Note: for the payroll report to work properly your date range must be a two week period starting on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday**_


## Split by division

If you selected the checkbox to split the report into divisions you will be provided a bi-weekly breakdown of total hours per employee for each day. It also divides the employees into their respective divisions.

If you have set a value for employee cost in each of your employee's [advanced settings page]({{< relref "/docs/employees.md" >}}#edit-an-employee) column B will contain that value which will populate the rightmost columns.

The split by division version of the report contains a subset of the columns you will find in the standard version of the payroll report.
