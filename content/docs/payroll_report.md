Select the date range you would like the report to cover and then click the button titled "Export the data". You will be prompted to download a XLSX containing your report.

_**Note: for the payroll report to work properly your date range must be a two week period starting on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday**_

The payroll report provides a bi-weekly breakdown of total hours per employee for each day. It also divides the employees into their respective departments.

If you have set a value for employee cost in each of your employee's [advanced settings page]({{< relref "/docs/employees.md" >}}#edit-an-employee) column B will contain that value which will populate the rightmost columns.

If you are an admin your report will contain data encompassing the entire company. If you are a manager it will only contain data pertaining to your employees
