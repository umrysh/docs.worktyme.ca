# Time slips

The time slip menu option will be available to you if you are an admin or are the direct supervisor of any other employees in the company (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information).

## View submitted time slips

Clicking on "Time slips" in the left hand menu will bring you to a calendar view of all the time slips submitted by the employees that report to you as well as any time slips submitted for a [division]({{< relref "/docs/divisions.md" >}}) in which you are an approver.

A manager can see all of their employee's time slips even if they are not able to approve the time. This is to account for times where an employee may spend some time performing work for another department. Their manager will want to be aware of this even though they will not be the one responsible for approving the time spent in the other department.

By default you are not shown time slips dated in the future or "locked" time slips (see [status options]({{< relref "/docs/time_slips_status.md" >}}) for more information). If you wish to view either of these types of time slips select the check boxes located beneath the right hand side of the calendar.

Time slips are colored based on their status to help differentiate them. There is a legend of the colors beneath the left hand side of the calendar.

* **Approved:** _Green_
* **Locked:** _Red_
* **Denied:** _Blue_
* **NA:** _Brown_
