# Billing

With Work Tyme we strive to make billing simple and straight forward. There are no hidden fees or surprises on your monthly invoice. We also process all payments with <a href="https://stripe.com" target_blank>Stripe</a> which means we never see your credit card information. 

With Work Tyme you receive your first three active accounts for free, forever. We don't even ask for your credit card information until you wish to add a fourth employee.

Once you have more than three active employees in your company we will begin billing you on a monthly basis for how many additional active employees you have at a rate of $8 CAD, per active employee per month. 

If you have four active employees you will be charged $8 CAD per month, if you have five active employees you would be charged $16 CAD per month, etc.

If an employee does not log into the web portal or check in a [time slip]({{< relref "/docs/time_slips.md" >}}) with one of the [mobile apps]({{< relref "/docs/apps.md" >}}) in a 30 day period, they will be marked inactive in the system and removed from your upcoming monthly invoice. Therefore you are only paying for employees that are actively using the Work Tyme system. The next time an inactive employee logs in or checks in a time slip they are added back onto your monthly bill as of that date.

It really is just that simple.
