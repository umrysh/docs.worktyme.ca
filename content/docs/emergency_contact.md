# Emergency contact information

Below the employee's contact information on their [profile page]({{< relref "/docs/profile_pages.md" >}}#employee-s-own-profile-page) there is a section regarding the employee's emergency contact. The employee can update this information at any time so that the HR team always has their most recent information.

Once the employee has made all the changes they need they can click on the button labeled "Update emergency contact" to save the changes.
