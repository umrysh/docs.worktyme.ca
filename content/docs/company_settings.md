# Company settings

To access the company settings page navigate to "Administration" and then click on "Company settings" in the left-hand menu. The "Administration" menu is only visible to the admins in your account (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information).

The company settings page can be thought of as way to set some general settings for your company

* **Company name for Sage exports:** _When you export timeslip data from Work Tyme to be imported into Sage 50 this value will be used for the "Customer" field_
* **Allowed sick days per year:** _The number of annual sick days your employees are entitled to. They will still be able to request more that this amount in a year. It is up to their manager if they wish to approve/deny additional sick days_
* **Enable job costing:** _If you wish to make use of the built-in [job costing]({{< relref "/docs/job_costing.md" >}}) module check this box_
* **Enable equipment usage tracking:** _If you wish to make use of the built-in [equipment usage tracking]({{< relref "/docs/equipment_usage_tracking.md" >}}) module check this box_
* **Enable happy birthday emails:** _Since Work Tyme has all of your employee's birthdays we thought we could give you the option if you would like us to send a birthday greeting email to them on their birthdays. All the admins on your account will also be BBC'd on these emails so they can get a reminder when it is someone's birthday :)_
