# Approvers

There are two ways to set an employee to be able to approve time for a particular division. You can do so via the department [divisions]({{< relref "/docs/divisions.md" >}}) page by clicking on the name of the division and selecting all the employees you would like to be made approvers.

Or by navigating to a particular employee in the directory, going into that employee's advanced settings, and selecting all the divisions you would like them to approve.

The department divisions and advanced employee settings pages are only visible to the admins in your account (see user types for more information).

## Managing approvers from within the department divisions module

While in the department divisions page click on the name of the division you wish to add/remove approvers

![Manage approvers](/docs/img/divisions_approvers.png)

The dropdown list will contain all of the employee's in your account. Select the employee you would like to make an approver for this division and click on the button labeled "Add approver". If you are just starting to set up your account you will be the only employee in the list.

To remove an employee from being an approver for this division click on the trash bin icon beside their name in the list.

Once you are finished adding approvers click on the button labeled "Save changes" to make your changes permanent.
