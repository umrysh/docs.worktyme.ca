# Expenses in the apps

If you have enabled the [expense tracking]({{< relref "/docs/expenses.md" >}}) module your users will gain access to the ability to upload expenses from within the mobile app.

_**Please note you must have an Internet connection to add an expense with the mobile app**_

The workflow of adding expenses from the Work Tyme mobile app will be different based on whether the logged in user is either a regular employee user or is an "Expenses Only" user (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information).

## Regular employees

### Add an expense

When a regular employee opens the mobile app they are presented with the [time slips]({{< relref "/docs/app_time_slips.md" >}}) screen as their home page. To add an expense open the app menu by using the three horizontal lines on the top left of the screen and click on "Add Expense". You will be taken to the add expense screen which looks like the following:

All employees have an option called "Personal Card" for expenses they will need to be reimbursed for_
* **Type of expense:** _Select from a list of expense types to better classify the expense. This list is not configurable. If you require an option added to the list please [let us know](https://worktyme.ca/#contact)_
