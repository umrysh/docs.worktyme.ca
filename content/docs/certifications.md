# Certifications

With Work Tyme you are able to track the certifications your employees have achieved. You can add in an expiry date for the certification (if applicable) and Work Tyme will alert all the admins and certification admins (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information) when a certification is within 60 days of expiry and then again once it officially expires.

_The certification menu option is only available to admins and certification admins_


## Add a certification

To add a certification into Work Tyme click on the "Certifications" menu option. You will be presented with a list of all the certifications currently added to your Work Tyme account. Depending on how close to expiry the certification is it may be colored in blue or red.
