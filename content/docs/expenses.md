# Expenses

With the expenses module enabled your staff will be able to upload their expenses into Work Tyme from anywhere in the world and your admins and expense admins (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information) will be able to instantaneously review and download expense reports. No more bundles of receipts being dropped off on the accountant's desk two weeks after the cut-off date.

## Enable/Disable expense tracking

Expense tracking is disabled by default. To enable or disable expense tracking visit the [company settings]({{< relref "/docs/company_settings.md" >}}) page and adjust the setting.

## Managing company cards

The first step in setting up your expense tracking module is adding in the company's credit cards (or any other type of cards) into your Work Tyme account and assigning them to the individuals who will be using them. This way when an employee is entering an expense they can assign the expense to the list of cards that have been assigned to them.

To manage your company cards you must be an admin or expense admin. Click on the menu option titled "Administration" and then "Company cards".

To add a new company card click on the button titled "Add company card" and enter in a description. You can enter anything but we suggest just using the last four digits of the credit card when possible.


## Add an expense

There are two ways to add an expense; either by using the [mobile app]({{< relref "/docs/app_expenses.md" >}}) or via the web portal. To see the steps when using the mobile app click [here]({{< relref "/docs/app_expenses.md" >}}). What follows are the steps to add an expense from the web portal.

## Download expense reports

When you view the expenses page as one of these two types of users there will be a reports section located directly below the expenses table.

There are a couple options you can select when generation your report:

* **Lock on export:** _If you wish to lock the expenses from being edited by non-admins after you generate this report._
