# Org chart

Work Tyme has a simple organization chart built in that is accessible for every employee. It can be used as a great reference tool for new employees to determine who everyone reports to in the company. The chart is generated based on the information set in each employee's [advanced settings]({{< relref "/docs/employees.md" >}}#edit-an-employee) page regarding their direct supervisor.
