# Reports

If your account is an admin or a manager (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information) you will have a menu option titled "Reports".

We currently have four types of reports:

* [Allocation]({{< relref "/docs/allocation_report.md" >}})
* [Email Addresses]({{< relref "/docs/email_report.md" >}})
* [Employee Summary]({{< relref "/docs/employee_summary_report.md" >}})
* [Payroll]({{< relref "/docs/payroll_report.md" >}})
