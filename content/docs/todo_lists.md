# Todo lists

Todo lists are how Work Tyme takes care of on-boarding for employees. You set up todo list templates for each [department]({{< relref "/docs/departments.md" >}}) in your company and then these are applied to the respective employees.

The first step in creating your tdo list templates is to upload any documents that will be required for your employees to read and/or sign off on

## Manage documents

To add documents to your Work Tyme account that can be utilized for todo lists click on the menu item labeled "Administration", then the option labeled "Todo lists" and finally "Files". The "Administration" menu is only visible to the admins in your account (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) for more information).

To add a file for use in todo templates click on the button titled "Upload new file" located above and to the left of the table. Select the PDF you would like to upload and Work Tyme will upload the file and add it to the list.

To remove a file click on the trash bin icon to the right of the file name and confirm your action

Once finished they will need to use their mouse to sign off in the signature box and click on the button titled "Save signature" to save their signature and mark the item as completed. They will be asked to confirm they have read and agree to the document before the signature will be saved.
