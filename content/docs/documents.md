# Employee Documents

Work Tyme admins (see [user types]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}})) are able to attach PDF documents to your employee's [profile pages]({{< relref "/docs/profile_pages.md" >}}). The uploaded documents are only visible to other admins. The employee document feature provides a handy way to store things like an employee's resume for future reference.

## Add a document

To add a document into Work Tyme navigate to the appropriate employee's [profile page]({{< relref "/docs/profile_pages.md" >}}) by using the [staff directory]({{< relref "/docs/directory.md" >}}) and scroll to the bottom of the page. Click on the button labeled "Upload a document".
