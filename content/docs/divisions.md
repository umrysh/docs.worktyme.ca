# Divisions

Divisions are the individual items to which an employee can allocate time when entering a time slip. For example, "Housekeeping", "Software development" or "The Johnson account".

Sub-divisions are used if you need a way to break down a division even further. For example if you have divisions referring to all of your individual clients you may want your employees to be able to further define how much time they spend in meetings with the client versus working on the clients projects. **If you do not add in any sub-divisions the system will provide your employees with a single option called "Production".**

_Note: Sub-divisions are not exported to Sage 50_

To make changes to department divisions click on the name of the department in the list. The department divisions page is only visible to the admins in your account (see user types for more information).

## Adding a division

To add a division click on the button labeled "Add division" and fill in the name of the division in the pop-up window. Then click "OK" to create the division.

_Note: If you plan to be exporting your employee's timeslips into Sage 50 then you need to make sure the names of the divisions match exactly to the Timeslip Divisions you have in your Sage 50 system_

# Next steps

Now that we have all of our [departments]({{< relref "/docs/departments.md" >}}) and divisions added we need to tell Work Tyme who should be allowed to approve any timeslips entered with these divisions
