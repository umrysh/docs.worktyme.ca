# Former employees

Work Tyme is designed so that you can retain information about former employees without worrying about being charged an ongoing fee for their accounts. If an employee does not login or check in time for a period of 30 days they are marked as inactive and removed from your monthly bill (see [**billing**]({{< relref "/docs/billing.md" >}}) for more information). This allows you to simply change a former employee's [password]({{< relref "/docs/employees.md" >}}#change-an-employee-s-password) so they no longer have access and then set the employee's termination date in their [advanced settings]({{< relref "/docs/employees.md" >}}#edit-an-employee) page.

Once this is done the former employee is removed from the [staff directory]({{< relref "/docs/directory.md" >}}) for your [regular users]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) and removed from the [organizational chart]({{< relref "/docs/org_chart.md" >}}).

The former employee will still appear in the [staff directory]({{< relref "/docs/directory.md" >}}) for [administrators]({{< relref "/docs/user_types.md" >}}) but will be highlighted in red to help differentiate them from the current employees. Clicking on the former employee's name in the directory will bring up the employee's [profile page]({{< relref "/docs/profile_pages.md" >}}) as before.
